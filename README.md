# ffmpeg-commands
Simple python wrapper functions for generating and executing ffmpeg commands:
* Create videofile from sequence of frames saved in .exr;
* Split videofile to sequence of frames;
* Concatinate multimple videos into one.

I was searching for any useful tips about all of this (especially concatinating) the other day and spent too much time researching and compiling all the information into  something that works well. So now i hope this can help someone to save some time on their research - maybe used as a template.
