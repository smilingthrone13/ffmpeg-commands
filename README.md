# ffmpeg-commands
Simple python wrapper functions for generating and executing ffmpeg commands:
* Create videofile from sequence of frames saved in .exr;
* Split videofile to sequence of frames;
* Concatenate multiple videos into one;
* Simple image resize.

I was searching for any useful tips about this (mostly concatenating) the other day and spent too much time researching and compiling all the information into something that works quite well. So now i hope this can help someone to save some time on their research - maybe by using this code as a template.
